# Bouncing-Ball
A relatively simple project that has an animated ball that bounces around within a window.
The size of the ball and its speed can be changed
The ball can be switched out for a bouncing square that gradually shifts through a rainbow gradient
The window can be resized without breaking the animation or trapping the ball outside the limits of the window
